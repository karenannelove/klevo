 		<h1>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website!</h1>
 		<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/3/005/03a/1d7/097f905.jpg">My name is Karen-Anne Levo. Iâ€™m a graphic designer and practicing artist based out of Toronto, Ontario.</p>
		<p>I graduated from the University of British Columbia, with a degree in the History of Art and a minor in Studio. I then attended B.C.I.T and Emily Carr University to earn my certification in Graphic Design. In the following years I've had the pleasure of working as an in-house designer for several small (but mighty!) Canadian businesses.</p>
		<p>I love the challenge behind developing effective design. I value the influence that visual choices have in communicating and reinforcing messages to large and diverse audiences. And most importantly I really enjoy creative work. With every client, employer and colleague I have worked with, the creative process always inspires enjoyment for everyone involved, which I find very rewarding.</p>
